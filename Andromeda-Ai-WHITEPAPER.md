# Andromeda AI – Autonomous DeFi Agent

## Abstract
This white paper introduces **Andromeda AI**, an advanced autonomous AI agent designed to manage a multi-chain crypto wallet, integrated across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The agent operates without human intervention, executing complex financial strategies including leverage trading, yield farming, lending/borrowing, and treasury management. Its goal is to autonomously generate yield, build a self-sustaining crypto reserve, and bring long-term value to its native token and its holders.

## 1. Introduction
Decentralized finance (DeFi) has unlocked unprecedented access to financial tools, but effective participation requires technical expertise, constant monitoring, and complex strategy execution. The average user is often overwhelmed, and inefficiencies abound in asset allocation and risk management.

This paper presents a solution: a self-improving autonomous AI agent that actively manages a multi-chain wallet, dynamically allocating capital across DeFi protocols to maximize returns, minimize risks, and optimize for the growth of its native ecosystem token.

### 3.3 Key Features and Allocations
- **Fair Launch (32.2%)**  
  96,500,000 $AiFi tokens are allocated for the fair launch. These tokens will be available for purchase during the public sale, allowing early investors to acquire $AiFi tokens and contribute to the liquidity of the project.

- **Liquidity on PancakeSwap - 10 Year Lock (29.0%)**  
  87,091,250 $AiFi tokens will be locked for 10 years in PancakeSwap, ensuring the liquidity remains stable and tamper-proof. This lockup helps prevent rug pulls and ensures the long-term market stability of the $AiFi token.

- **Reserve Fund (10.8%)**  
  32,259,319.76 $AiFi will be reserved for future developments, strategic partnerships, and potential emergency uses. This fund will be vested over a period of 2.5 years, preventing premature use of these tokens and ensuring their availability for growth and sustainability.

- **AI Agent Fund (10.0%)**  
  29,979,245.8 $AiFi tokens are unlocked at the Token Generation Event (TGE) and will be used by the AI agent to execute high-performance DeFi strategies such as leverage trading, yield farming, and lending/borrowing. The profits generated from these activities will be used to buy back tokens from the market, reducing the circulating supply and increasing protocol-owned liquidity (POL).

- **Liquidity for Lending/Borrowing (10.0%)**  
  29,979,245.8 $AiFi tokens will be allocated to support liquidity pools on lending and borrowing platforms. These tokens will also be vested over 2.5 years to ensure responsible usage of the liquidity and prevent large-scale liquidations.

- **Liquidity Incentives (5.0%)**  
  14,989,622.9 $AiFi will be allocated to incentivize liquidity providers across various DeFi platforms and chains. This will help to bootstrap liquidity, encourage ecosystem engagement, and ensure long-term participation from users. These tokens will also be vested over 2.5 years.

- **Marketing (3.0%)**  
  8,993,773.74 $AiFi will be used to fund marketing campaigns, partnerships, and promotional activities to grow the project’s user base, increase awareness, and drive adoption across the DeFi ecosystem. These tokens will also be vested over 2.5 years.

### 3.4 Immutable Buy/Sell Tax of 0.25%
*(equivalent to 25 basis points, or a quarter of a percent)*

- **Immutable Tax Rate**  
  The 0.25% Buy/Sell Tax is immutable and cannot be altered. This fixed tax ensures long-term predictability and stability for the ecosystem, with no risk of changes that could affect holders or liquidity providers.

- A 0.25% tax will be levied on all buy and sell transactions of $AiFi on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This fixed tax is utilized to enhance the ecosystem’s sustainability and growth. The tax revenue will be directed to the protocol treasury wallet and used for the following purposes:

  - **Buyback Mechanism:** Profits generated from the AI agent's strategies (e.g., leverage trading, yield farming) will be used to buy back $AiFi tokens from the market. These tokens will be added to the liquidity pool, increasing protocol-owned liquidity (POL) and reducing the circulating supply.

  - **Protocol Treasury:** The tax will grow the protocol treasury, which will be used for development, audits, partnerships, marketing, and liquidity injections to maintain ecosystem health and sustainability.

  - **Transparency & Trust:** This transparent tax mechanism ensures that the project remains self-sustaining and reduces reliance on external funding, aligning incentives between the project and its token holders.
